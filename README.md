# Blockchain-Ledger
This code implements a smart contract in Solidity, a language for writing smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a state variable for energy, carbon credits, and renewable energy certificates, and two functions: validateAndPackage and sell.

The validateAndPackage function takes in inputs for energy, carbon credits, and renewable energy certificates, validates them to make sure they're greater than 0, and updates the state variables with the validated inputs. It also emits a NewValidation event with the updated energy, carbon credits, and renewable energy certificates.

The sell function takes in inputs for energy, carbon credits, and renewable energy certificates, validates them to make sure they're less than or equal to the packaged quantities, and updates the state variables with the sold quantities.

Enfut Bid defines a smart contract called VirtualPowerPlant that manages the transfer of credits, bidding on credits and excess energy, and negotiation for better pricing between entities. The contract uses a mapping of entities to their credits and excess energy, and defines functions for transferring credits, placing a bid, and negotiating for better pricing.

The contract also emits events for each credit transfer, bid placed, and negotiated price, which can be used to trigger actions or updates on the front-end interface.

This code can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Remix or Truffle, and can be interacted with using a web3 interface or a tool like Remix or Remix.
